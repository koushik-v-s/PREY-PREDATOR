This project presents a comprehensive simulation of the Lotka-Volterra model, a mathematical framework used to describe the dynamics of biological interactions between prey and predator populations. 
The simulation employs numerical methods, specifically the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method and the adaptive Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4/5 (RKF45) method, to analyze and visualize the population dynamics over a specified time frame. 
The Lotka-Volterra equations are fundamental in theoretical ecology, providing insights into the cyclical nature of species interactions and their implications for ecosystem management.
This project serves as an educational and research tool for studying ecological dynamics, offering a user-friendly platform for exploring the intricate relationships between species.
By integrating numerical methods into the analysis, the simulation provides insights into the stability and fluctuations of populations in various ecological contexts. 
Future work could expand the model to incorporate additional complexities, such as multiple species interactions, environmental factors, and carrying capacities, further enhancing its applicability in ecological research and management.
